To-do-app with logging simulation.

---

This application can:

Simulate signing you. While signing up you must go thorugh validation process. It's return feedback when something's gone wrong, then user can correct input data, and when everything's is fine then it add your profile to a localStorage. After signing up you can create another account or log in into service. When you are logged then you can add tasks to your list which are assigned to account.

Things to add in future:

Because it was five days challange with my friend and I had limited time because work and home chores there is some things to do before I will think about this project like it's finished. 

I want to add:
- possibility to remove tasks
- possibility to search tasks by it's title

End:

For now I consider this project like it is finished and I move further to next challange which is pong.
